First, we rewrite equations:
	y = -3/4 * x - 2
	x = -3/4 * y - 7/4

Thus, our multipliers b1 & b2 are:
	b1 = b2 = -3/4

In last tutorial we find new formula for PCC(Pearson Correlation Coefficient):
	b = p * (std_dev_y)/(std_dev_x)
	-> 
	p = b * (std_dev_x)/(std_dev_y)

Therefore:
	p ** 2 = b1 * b2
	p ** 2 = 9/16
	p = -3/4 of 3/4 

Because of our original equations have negative slopes, we consider x & y have
negative correlation:
	p = -3/4
