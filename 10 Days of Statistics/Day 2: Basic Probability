When we roll two dice, we have 6 possibilities for each roll
Thus, there is 36 outcomes

But, we have a condition, that their sum will be less then 9 (at most 9)
So, only 6 combinations are not satisfy the conditions:
	{6,4},{6,5},{6,6},{4,6},{5,5},{5,6}
Thereby, 36 - 6 = 30 and total of favourite outcomes:
	P(A) = 30/36 = 5/6
